			<h2><span  >Subject and purpose of data collection/data processing</span></h2>

<p><span  >Oview, limited liability partnership (LLP), including its subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, contractors, and all data sources and suppliers, (collectively “Oview”, “we”, “us” or “our”) – a global online platform where opinions are created, acknowledged and transformed into universally accessible visualised data with the intention to induce a civilization that is inspired by the freely created opinions of the majority, which are supported by unbiased information. </span></p>
<p><span  >Oview provides access to a system where users can:</span></p>
<p><span  >– create polar questions (Yes/No questions) about current articles (the “</span><span  >survey questions</span><span  >”). This is done via the backend;</span></p>
<p><span  >– answer </span><span  >the survey questions.</span></p>
<p><span  >It is important to note that all analysis of the survey results such as reports, statistical tables, charts, graphics or other visual forms (“statistical reports”), are always aggregated into statistical information without compromising individual votes.</span></p>
<p><span  >For these purposes Oview asks you to provide your personal data which will be used by Oview to create statistical reports based on personal opinions about different news articles, items, issues, topics, and other internet sources which users link while creating their survey questions in order to help other </span><span  >users </span><span  >to understand the general context of these survey questions</span> <span  >(the “articles”). Oview provides you with access to our services only after you create an account in Oview as defined in the Privacy Policy in the part “Registration in Oview”. As soon as you sign the Terms and Conditions and finish the whole registration process in the Oview <a href="https://cms.oviewapp.com">backend of the app</a> or in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.oview.app">the mobile app</a> (the “registration”), your personal data will be transferred to Oview and you will become an Oview user (the “user”). Becoming an Oview user contains the right to express your opinion by voluntary participation in survey questions and/or the right to create survey questions. </span></p>

It is possible at any point to remove and/or add personal data, and that will immediately change the extent of access to the relevant statistical reports.</span></p>
